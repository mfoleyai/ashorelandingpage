# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 30, 2025

Ashore AI LLC ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application, SeeSell ("the App").

In this policy, "you," "your," or "user" refers to any individual who creates an account or otherwise uses SeeSell. By doing so, you explicitly consent to the collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Contact Information

**Company Name:** Ashore AI LLC

**Email:** privacy@ashoreai.com

## Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information when you use SeeSell:

### Contact Information
**Email Address:** Collected and securely stored in Firebase Authentication for account creation, login, and identity management.

### User Content
**Photos or Videos:** Collected in base64 format and securely transmitted to third-party language models (LLMs) to generate item listings. These images are currently processed in memory and are not stored or logged persistently by our backend.

While photos are not stored, they are submitted as part of an authenticated session and are associated with your account during processing.

In the future, we may retain image data solely to improve listing quality, enhance user experience, and train our own AI models for these purposes. If this occurs, we will notify users and update this Privacy Policy accordingly. This data will never be sold, used for advertising, or shared with third parties for their own model training.

### Identifiers
**Firebase User ID:** Generated by Firebase Authentication to uniquely identify users and manage account-related data, including credit balances and purchase history.

**Device ID:** To help prevent abuse and ensure requests come from real devices, SeeSell uses Firebase App Check. This tool checks your device locally and sends a security token to our backend. We do not access, transmit, or store your device ID.

### Purchases
**Purchase History & Transaction IDs:** Collected and stored in Firestore and RevenueCat to fulfill purchases, manage subscriptions, maintain credit balances, and prevent duplicate redemptions of free credits.

## Purpose of Information Collection

We use collected data to:
- Facilitate app functionality, including account creation, user authentication, and listing generation.
- Process transactions, manage subscriptions, and maintain user credit balances.
- Ensure the security, integrity, and abuse protection of our services.
- Improve the accuracy, reliability, and overall quality of the app experience.

## Third-Party Service Providers

We use the following third-party services to operate SeeSell:
- **Firebase (Google):** For user authentication, device validation (App Check), and credit tracking and storage via Firestore.
- **Google Cloud Run:** For secure hosting of our backend services and processing of user-submitted data.
- **RevenueCat:** To manage in-app purchases, validate subscription status, and track associated purchase metadata.

We encourage you to review the RevenueCat privacy policy for more information: 

RevenueCat Privacy Policy: https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/

In the future, we may utilize Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, or Performance Monitoring to improve reliability and enhance user experience. If these services are enabled, usage or crash data may be collected and analyzed accordingly, and we will update this Privacy Policy and our App Store privacy disclosures to reflect any new data collection.

## Third-Party AI Services

To provide our core listing generation functionality, SeeSell transmits user-submitted photos to third-party AI services, including but not limited to:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google

These services process the content in real time to generate suggested titles, descriptions, and other listing information.

These third-party providers may retain or log submitted content in accordance with their own data handling practices. While we take reasonable steps to transmit data securely and ensure it is used solely for its intended purpose, we do not control how these providers handle your data on their systems.

We encourage you to review their privacy policies for more information:

OpenAI Privacy Policy: https://openai.com/privacy  

Anthropic Privacy Policy: https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy  

Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

By using SeeSell, you consent to the processing of your data by these third-party AI providers for the purposes described above.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. Your data is shared only with the third-party providers listed in this policy, and only for the purposes necessary to operate SeeSell.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, or corporate reorganization involving the transfer of user data, we will provide advance notice within the app or via email. You will have the opportunity to review the new data practices and manage your information accordingly.

## User Rights and Controls

### Account Deletion
You can delete your account and associated data from Firebase and RevenueCat directly via the app.

When you delete your account through SeeSell:
- Your stored email address, Firebase user ID, credit balances, and purchase history are removed from our systems.
- Your data in RevenueCat is deleted to the extent permitted by their systems and Apple's in-app purchase infrastructure.

For the sole purpose of preventing fraud and abuse—such as repeated attempts to claim free signup credits—we may retain a pseudonymized version of your email address (e.g., a salted cryptographic hash). This allows us to detect repeat sign-ups without storing any personally identifiable information. These records are:
- Not used for marketing, personalization, or analytics
- Stored securely
- Used only for abuse prevention

### Data Access Requests
You may request a copy of your personal data by contacting us at privacy@ashoreai.com. Please note that modification of certain account information, such as your email address, is not currently supported.

### California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, you have the right to:
- Request a copy of the personal information we hold about you
- Delete your account and associated data directly through the app
- Understand that we do not sell your personal information

## Security Measures

We implement industry-standard technical and organizational safeguards to help protect your personal data:
- **Secure Transmission:** All data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.
- **Access Controls:** Firebase Authentication and App Check are used to restrict access to authorized users and prevent unauthorized requests.
- **Database Security:** Access to our Firestore database is tightly controlled using Firebase's authentication and access rules.
- **Secure AI Processing:** Photos and listing data are transmitted securely to third-party language model providers via API, and processed in memory unless explicitly retained as described elsewhere in this policy.
- **Minimal Storage:** We do not persistently store data beyond what is necessary for core functionality (e.g., authentication or fraud prevention).
- **Payment Data:** All payment processing is handled by Apple and RevenueCat. We do not collect or store credit card or billing information on our servers.

## Data Retention

We retain your data as follows:
- **Email Addresses and Firebase User IDs:** Stored securely in Firebase Authentication and retained for as long as your account remains active. To prevent repeated account creation for the purpose of abusing free credit offerings, we may retain a pseudonymized version of your email address even after account deletion.
- **Photos or Videos:** Currently processed temporarily in memory for listing generation and not stored persistently on our servers. In the future, we may retain image data solely to improve listing quality, enhance user experience, and train our own AI models for these purposes.
- **Purchase History and Transaction IDs:** Retained in Firebase and RevenueCat during your account's lifetime. After account deletion, we may retain limited pseudonymized purchase records for the sole purpose of preventing fraud, abuse, or duplicate redemptions of free credits.

## User Responsibility

You are responsible for ensuring that you have the legal right to submit images and other content to SeeSell. By using the app, you confirm that any submitted content does not infringe on copyrights, trademarks, privacy rights, or other legal rights of third parties.

## Children's Privacy

SeeSell is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, we will promptly delete that information.

## International Data Transfers

Your data may be processed or transferred to the United States or other jurisdictions where our third-party service providers operate. In such cases, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and industry best practices.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, or legal obligations.

When we make material changes—such as updates to how your data is collected, used, or stored—we will notify you within the app and update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. Continued use of SeeSell after such updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.

If you do not agree to the updated terms, you may delete your account at any time through the app's settings.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your data.
